  ## Description

  This website is a Weather Dashboard which allows a user to enter a city into an input box and the user is presented with the current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast for that city.  Weather data is pulled from the Open Weather Map API.  The weather conditions are dynamically rendered onto the page in card format for each day.  As the user enters city names they are saved into local storage (the most recent 5 cities) and buttons are rendered onto the screen so that the user can easy click them to quickly get the weather data for those cities.  Weather conditions include temperature in Farenheit, Wind Speed, Humidity, and a weather icon (which shows whether it is sunny, cloudy, raining, snowing, etc)
